A guy with his phone to his ear, apparently a co-worker, stepped over and rapped sharply on the bar. I’d violated a rule. All customers, per the decree, are to sit at tables. This is part of the mandate that people are to maintain a one-meter distance from each other. Stefano said that if a policeman drove by and saw me drinking coffee at the counter, he could be fined several thousand euros. He also reported that city officials had been driving past with bullhorns, urging everybody to stay inside.",
  "translation": "斯特凡诺把我的咖啡放在柜台上。 通常，在一家意大利咖啡店中，您站在酒吧里喝一小杯浓缩咖啡。 当我们继续交谈时，我喝了几口。 一个听电话的家伙，显然是一个同事，走过去，猛烈地敲打酒吧。 我违反了规则。 根据法令，所有客户都应坐在餐桌旁。 这是人们必须彼此保持一米距离的任务的一部分。 斯特凡诺说，如果一个警察开车过去，看到我在柜台喝咖啡，他可能会被罚款数千欧元。 他还报告说，市政官员一直在用扩音器开车过去，敦促所有人留在里面。"
